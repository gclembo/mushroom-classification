In this project I created a model to classify if a mushroom is edible or poisonous. 
I used data from the mushroom classification dataset from Kaggle which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification. 
For this project I created a simple pipeline containing a one hot encoder and decision tree classifier and was able to use model importances to eliminate unhelpful features.
